                Hi there! I'm Priyanka Gautam, a software engineer driven by a
                passion for technology's power to solve complex challenges and
                positively impact lives. Iâ€™m drawn towards innovation, and my
                experiences have fueled my commitment and enthusiasm to use
                technology to create solutions that truly make a difference.
                <br /> <br />
                At New Relic, I developed and launched a Distributed Tracing Setup Wizard and 
                engineered performance-enhancing algorithms, focusing on technical excellence and user experience.  I thrive in
                environments that require creativity, adaptability, and strong
                communication.
                <br /> <br />
                I'm known for my open-minded approach and ability to connect with
                others, making me an effective collaborator in diverse team
                settings. I have a passion for mentoring and have successfully
                guided over 80 engineering students. My
                adaptability and enthusiasm for continuous learning have been
                crucial to my success in both academic and professional
                environments.
                <br /> <br />
                Outside of work, I love exploring new technologies, 
                participating in hackathons, and engaging with the tech community. Let's connect or collaborate on exciting projects!
