                Hi there! I'm Priyanka Gautam, a software engineer driven by a
                passion for technology's power to solve complex challenges and
                positively impact lives. Iâ€™m drawn towards innovation, and my
                experiences have fueled my commitment and enthusiasm to use
                technology to create solutions that truly make a difference.
                <br /> <br />
                At New Relic, I developed and launched a Distributed Tracing
                Setup Wizard and engineered performance-enhancing algorithms,
                focusing on technical excellence and user experience. I thrive
                in environments that require creativity, adaptability, and
                strong communication.
                <br /> <br />
                I'm known for my open-minded approach and ability to connect
                with others, making me an effective collaborator in diverse team
                settings. I have a passion for mentoring and have successfully
                guided over 80 engineering students. My adaptability and
                enthusiasm for continuous learning have been crucial to my
                success in both academic and professional environments.
                <br /> <br />
                Outside of work, I love exploring new technologies,
                participating in hackathons, and engaging with the tech
                community. Let's connect or collaborate on exciting projects!
